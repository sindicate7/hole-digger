# Greed - Asset Pipeline & Visual Polish 🎨

## Your Mission: Low-Poly Assets for On-Chain Game

### Tasks (Branch: `greed/asset-pipeline`)

1. **Character Model** 🐻
   - Find CC0 low-poly character (matches Keep Digging aesthetic)
   - Bear, miner, or robot character preferred  
   - Convert to .glb/.gltf format for Three.js
   - Replace cube player in `Player.tsx`
   - Animate idle/walking states (optional)

2. **Environment Assets** 🌲
   - Low-poly tree models (various sizes, forest feel)
   - Rock/stone models for ground scatter
   - Dirt/grass textures with good tiling
   - Treasure chest models (for future NFT items)

3. **Blockchain Visual Elements** 💎
   - Digging tool models (shovel, pickaxe)
   - Treasure/gem models (bronze, silver, gold, diamond)
   - Hole visualization assets
   - Transaction success/pending indicators

4. **Asset Integration** 🔧
   - Create organized `assets/` folder structure
   - Optimize file sizes for web loading
   - Test assets work in React Three Fiber
   - Document licenses and attribution

### Asset Sources (CC0 License Required)
- **Kenny Assets**: https://kenney.nl/assets (excellent low-poly packs)
- **Quaternius**: https://quaternius.com/packs.html (RPG/adventure assets)
- **Sketchfab CC0**: https://sketchfab.com/features/free-3d-models
- **OpenGameArt**: https://opengameart.org

### Files to Work On
- `app/src/assets/` - create organized asset folders
- `app/src/components/Player.tsx` - integrate character model
- `app/src/components/Environment.tsx` - trees, rocks, atmosphere
- `app/src/components/Treasures.tsx` - gem/treasure models
- `ASSETS.md` - document sources, licenses, usage

### Success Criteria  
- ✅ Character model replaces cube (looks like Keep Digging)
- ✅ Environment feels alive with trees, rocks, atmosphere
- ✅ Ground texture is appealing and fits aesthetic
- ✅ Treasure models ready for blockchain integration
- ✅ All assets properly licensed (CC0) and attributed

### Priority Order
1. **Character model** (immediate visual impact)
2. **Ground texture** (foundation for everything)  
3. **Tree models** (environment depth)
4. **Treasure models** (blockchain integration ready)
5. **Atmosphere/polish** (lighting, skybox)

### Keep Digging Inspiration
- Chunky, low-poly aesthetic
- Earth tones (browns, greens)
- Cozy underground mining feel
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Satisfying dig feedback

**Target: Assets integrated by 02:00 UTC** ⏰

**You're building the visual world that makes blockchain gaming delightful! ✨**
