# Wrath - Code Review & Security 🛡️

## Your Mission: Quality Assurance & Testing

### Tasks (No dedicated branch - review others')

1. **Code Reviews**
   - Review PRs from Lust (scene/movement)
   - Review PRs from Sloth (dig mechanics)  
   - Review PRs from Greed (asset integration)
   - Focus on performance, security, best practices

2. **Testing & Validation**
   - Test movement controls (WASD responsiveness)
   - Test dig mechanics (click accuracy, hole placement)
   - Test asset loading (performance, memory usage)
   - Browser compatibility testing

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Check FPS during gameplay
   - Monitor memory usage with assets
   - Test on different screen sizes
   - Identify optimization opportunities

### Areas to Focus On
- **Input handling**: Smooth controls, no input lag
- **Performance**: 60fps target, efficient rendering
- **User experience**: Intuitive interactions
- **Error handling**: Graceful asset loading failures
- **Code quality**: TypeScript types, clean structure

### Tools & Metrics
- Browser DevTools Performance tab
- Three.js Stats for FPS monitoring  
- Memory usage profiling
- Mobile device testing (optional)

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All features work smoothly
- ✅ No major performance issues
- ✅ Code follows React/Three.js best practices
- ✅ User experience is polished

**Target: Ongoing reviews, final validation by morning** 🎯
