# 🕳️ Hole Digger - 3D Prototype

## Overview
A playable 3D hole digging game built with React Three Fiber. Click to dig holes in a low-poly world.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite
- **3D Engine:** Three.js + React Three Fiber + Drei
- **Aesthetic:** Low-poly, minimalist design
- **Camera:** Third-person following player

## Overnight MVP Goals

### 🎮 Core Features
- [x] ~~Vite + React + TypeScript setup~~
- [ ] **R3F Scene** (Lust): Ground plane, player character, WASD movement, camera
- [ ] **Dig Mechanics** (Sloth): Click-to-dig holes, local dig counter
- [ ] **Assets** (Greed): Low-poly textures, tree models, character model

### 🎯 Success Criteria
**"I want to click and dig holes in a 3D world when I wake up"** - Tuna

## Development Setup

```bash
cd app/
npm install
npm run dev
```
